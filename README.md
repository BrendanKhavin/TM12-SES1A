# Software Engineering Studio 1A - Team 12
This is the GitHub repository for Software Engineering Studio 1A - Team 12.

## File Naming Structure
In this repository there are many different files all stored in the root directory, to help with the organisation a file naming structure has been implemented.

Files with the prefix **MAIN** refer to pages on the main page of the website, these pages are accessible at all times.

Files with the prefix **DOC** refer to pages that are only accessible if a user is logged in as a doctor.

Files with the prefix **PAT** refer to pages that are only accessible if a user is logged in as a patient.

The file titled **WebsiteScript.js** is the JavaScript file applied to the whole website.

The file titled **WebsiteStyling.css** is the CSS file that is applied to the whole website.

The file titled **WebsiteSkeletonStructure-[DO-NOT-EDIT].htm** is a skeleton file that can be used to create new pages on the website. It contains the basic structure of the site, namely the top navigation bar and the footer bar. It is indicated in the WebsiteStyling.css file where the styling stops for the WebsiteSkeletonStructure-[DO-NOT-EDIT].htm file.
