				<span class="enquiryPage"><p>Here you will find some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and their corresponding answers. If your query cannot be resolved here, you may opt to complete an <a href="MAIN-ContactPage.htm#Enquiry">enquiry form</a>.</p></span>

				<h3>Telephoning your doctor</h3>
				<p>Doctors should be available to take calls unless they are busy in a consultation with another patient, in which case your call will be returned as soon as possible.</p>
				
				<h3>What hours are we open?</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>Monday 8:00am – 9:30pm</li>

				</p>
				
				<h3>Do I need to book an appointment?</h3>
				<p>We accept booking an appointment online, but a limited number of 50 walk-in patients are welcome - but you must be 1.5 metres apart from the adjacent person, due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. We recommend that you book your appointment at your preferred time because we cannot guarantee wait time for patients who come in without a booking.</p>
				
				<h3>Should I go to the emergency room or the Online Medical Centre?</h3>
				<p>See below several examples classified as medical emergencies, which would require you to call Triple Zero (000):
					<ul>
						<li>Fainting/unconsciousness</li>
						<li>Choking</li>
						<li>Burns</li>
						<li>Poison ingestion</li>
						<li>Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath</li>
						<li>Chest tightness or chest pain</li>
						<li>Injury from a major car accident</li>
						<li>Uncontrollable bleeding that does not stop after 15 minutes of direct pressure</li>
						<li>Sudden paralysis or numbness in a portion of your body and/or abrupt onset of weakness</li>
						<li>Displaced or broken bones</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>An emergency is an acute illness or injury that could cause death or long-term health damage if not treated promptly. Extreme pain in some instances such as soreness associated with appendicitis or kidney stones can also be considered a medical emergency. Only visit the Online Medical Centre for professionals to recommend remedies, medicine and prescriptions for non-life-threatening illnesses or injuries. Please contact an ambulance or the emergency room if you are experiencing severe symptoms listed above.</p>
				
				<h3>What if I want to cancel/change an appointment?</h3>
				<p>Please let us know to cancel or change your appointment time if you are unable to attend for a scheduled appointment. We issue appointment reminders to mobile numbers registered in our database as a courtesy and request a minimum of 1-hour notice if you cannot attend.</p>
				
				<h3>How do I get a medical certificate?</h3>
				<p>Medical Certificates are available and can be requested following your consultation with your doctor, if they are convinced that you are suffering from problems affecting your health and wellbeing. Unfortunately, backdated certificates cannot be provided to you. If you require a special consideration certificate, please bring the necessary documents to your appointment.</p>
				
				<h3>How do I get my test results?</h3>
				<p>Shortly after your appointment, your doctor will inform you when they expect your results to arrive at the practice. Mostly, advice of “normal” test results will be sent to you by mail. If we have detected results that are considered clinically serious, we will contact you as soon as possible to organise a follow-up appointment and discuss treatments or potential solutions of your results.</p>
